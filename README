shell script.
file comes from many different servers will be check automatically.
if it is equal to the number of predefined file.
return 1 (to launch another job)
else return 0 ( wait and do nothing)
hard part: 
  the differnt day will have different file.
  received file time is from the last time file has been received and processed.
  
solution:
  make a file contain list of intended to receive file for each day ( 7 file total).
  make a file contain The intended date of receipt of the file.
  get time received file and compare it with above file.
